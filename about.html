      I am an English based illustrator specialising in childrens illustration and greeting card design, as well as ceramics, wall art and housewares design too. I was born in Manchester where I grew up, but now live in the North East having two grown up daughters.
     
      From an early age, the artistic tendencies were evident. Never without felt tips and pencil crayons in hand, illustrating anything from school fete posters, to a picture bingo travel version, to entertain my sisters and I on the long road trips to summer holidays in North Wales!
      <br>
      <br>
      I went on to study at Staffordshire University, where I graduated with a degree in Ceramics and Surface Pattern Design, so naturally started my career working as an in-house designer for a local long established ceramic manufacturer. One of my main achievements here, was being instrumental in securing the Harry Potter license; working on the creative bid and snatching it from the clutches of much larger big name companies in the pottery industry! It was a great experience to learn the ropes of a fast paced industry entrenched in trends, pattern and colour and enabled me to combine my love of creating pattern, detail, and textures with the fabulous versatility of design produced through the technology of Mac computers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Being established as a freelancer designer for many years since, and after having had two lovely daughters, I naturally ventured into to the wonderful world of childrens book illustration in 2012, where my love of pattern and design has been applied anew. Itâ€™s a fabulous area and challenge that I relish. I have illustrated 150 books to date and am now venturing into authoring them too. It is a career that is forever rewarding and challenging, and I feel very lucky to be able to do this for a living!
